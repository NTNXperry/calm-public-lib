* **Calm-Custom-Provider-Scripts**: Custom Providers in Calm enable users to connect Calm to clouds for which native API integrations may not exist yet. See the [Calm documentation](http://docs.calm.io/using_calm/#configuring-calm-with-your-custom-provider) for more information on how to use custom providers with Calm. Calm currently has custom providers for Digital Ocean, Softlayer, Proxmox and OpenNebula based clouds. Even some of the AWS services like RDS can be managed as a Custom Provider.
